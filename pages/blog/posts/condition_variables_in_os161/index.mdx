### What are condition variables?

The definition surrounding condition variables is a little questionable. Technically a condition variable is:
> A container of threads that are waiting for a certain condition
>
> — <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization)" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></cite>

However, many people refer to them as what they should be referred to as **Monitors**. A monitor is:
> a synchronization construct that allows threads to have both mutual exclusion and the ability to wait (block) for a certain condition to become false. Monitors also have a mechanism for signaling other threads that their condition has been met. A monitor consists of a mutex (lock) object and **condition variables**.

All things considered, it doesn't matter too much as long as there isn't any confusion.

### Use-case

A common use of monitors is a bounded buffer 

```java
void put(int number)
{
  lock_acquire(cv_lock);
  while (itemsFull)
  {
    cv_wait(itemsNotFull, cv_lock);
  }

  items.add(number);

  cv_signal(itemsNotEmpty, cv_lock);
  lock_release(cv_lock);
}

void take()
{
  lock_acquire(cv_lock);
  while (itemsEmpty)
  {
    cv_wait(itemsNotEmpty, cv_lock);
  }

  int number = items.poll();

  cv_signal(itemsNotFull, cv_lock);
  lock_release(cv_lock);
}
```

### Implementation

This post assumes you have already implemented locks in OS161. If you haven't please check out <Link href={"/blog/posts/locks_in_os161"}><a href="#" style={{color: "#e83e8c"}}>implementing locks in OS161</a></Link>

As above, to implement a monitor we need a lock and the actual condition variable. We already have our lock, but we still need our representation of
a condition variable. To represent a condition variable all we need is a wait channel (wchan). Our condition variable struct only needs to contain
a wait channel and a name. In reality, we don't need a name, but our wait channel does so we should just add it.

There is one more thing we need that is specific to OS161 to implement our monitor: a spinlock. Since we are using a wait channel for our implementation, the wait channel
is not inherently thread-safe. Meaning, we have to guard the wait channel ourselves with a spinlock.

Note: each condition variable has its own wait channel

**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`Create`</span> :**

We need to create our wait channel, initialize our spinlock, and allocate space for our condition variable.
We don't need to handle any synchronization in the creation of our monitor.

**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`Destroy`</span> :**

Destroying is basically just freeing up the memory that we allocated in creation, cleaning up the spinlock, and
destroying the wait channel.

**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`Wait`</span> :**
 
We want to acquire our wait channels spinlock in order to protect it. From the example use-case above, we should already hold
our monitors lock. Before we sleep on the wait channel we want to release the lock in-order to let someone else use it while we
are sleeping (not doing anything). Once we've released the lock we sleep on the wait channel. When we are woken up we need to release 
the wait channel's spin lock and reacquire our monitor's lock.

**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`Signal`</span> :**

Signal is very easy! All we need to do is wake someone up that is sleeping on the wait channel. Don't forget to protect it with its spinlock.

**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`Broadcast`</span> :**

Broadcast is identical to `signal(...)` with the exception of instead of waking up only one thread, we wake up all threads.
