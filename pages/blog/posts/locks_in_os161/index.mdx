### What are locks?

Locks are:
> a synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource in an environment where there are many threads of execution. A lock is designed to enforce a mutual exclusion concurrency control policy.

### How do we implement them in OS161?

We will be implementing the simplest type of lock: a binary semaphore. This binary semaphore will guard the access
of resources by sleeping the execution of threads that request the lock until they are allowed to access it.

#### Semaphores in OS161

OS161 already gives us an implementation of a counting semaphore using wait channels (wchan) through the 
**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`P`</span>** and **<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`V`</span>** functions.
I like to call them "wait" and "signal"; it makes more intuitive sense to me.

**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`P`</span> :**
1. Acquire the spinlock of the semaphore since the semaphore is a shared resource 
2. Check if there are resources available (`sem_count > 0`)
3. If resources are available goto 
4. Otherwise, we sleep the thread that wants to acquire the spinlock to avoid busy waiting
5. Sleeping...
6. When woken-up goto step 1.
7. There are now resources available, decrement `sem_count`
8. Release the spinlock

**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`V`</span> :**

1. Acquire the spinlock of the semaphore
2. Increment `sem_count` to indicate resources are now available
3. Wake a thread on the wait channel to indicate "Hey, resources are available! You can continue execution"
4. Release the spinlock

Note: the wait channel (wchan) is a shared resource, so in step 4 (**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`P`</span>**) 
and step 3 (**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`V`</span>**) we acquire and release the
wchan lock.

#### Binary Semaphores

A binary semaphore is just a counting semaphore with values 0 or 1. This represents how there is only one resource
available at a time. In otherwords, only one thread can acquire the resource at a time.

The above functions **<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`P`</span>** and
**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`V`</span>** describe this diagram where `sem_count = {0, 1}`

### Implementation

Lucky for us, OS161 already has an implementation of spinlocks! We will need this to protect our binary semaphore. 
Since our lock is effectively this binary semaphore, it will look **almost identical** to the
implemenation of the counting semaphore already provided. 

Our lock must depend on a wait channel, spinlock, and state. If implementing a function that checks who holds the lock
we will also need an owner. It's safe to say your lock struct should have these things included in some fashion.

**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`Create`</span> :**

We need to initialize all of our synchronization primitives and allocate space for our lock.
There will be no owner of the lock (`NULL`).
We don't need to handle any synchronization in the creation of our lock.

**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`Destroy`</span> :**

Destroying is basically just freeing up the memory that we allocated in creation, cleaning up the spinlock, and
destroying the wait channel.

**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`Acquire`</span> :**

We want to acquire our spinlock and check if the resource is available. While the resource is unavailable 
we sleep on the wait channel till someone wakes us up.

Once the resource is available we make the resource unavailable and release the spinlock.

Note: it might seem weird that we release the spinlock right away, but remember it is not the actual lock, it is
the *inner* lock that protects our binary semaphore and any other non-synchronized fields. Our binary semaphores
`state` is the real lock.

**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`Release`</span> :**

We acquire the spinlock set our binary semaphores state to 1 indicating the resource is available. After the state
is set to 1 we want to wake up a thread that is sleeping on the wait channel. We then release the spinlock.

**<span style={{fontSize: 'larger'}}>`Who holds the lock?`</span> :**

To check who holds the lock we should acquire the spinlock and compare the current thread with a saved owner thread
of the lock.
